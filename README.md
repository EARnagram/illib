# Illib

### A Web App for Comic Collectors

- Application would allow users to keep track of their comic book collections.

- Users can find out about other comics based on other users' libraries.

##### Find on Heroku: `https://illib.herokuapp.com/`

#### Design

I'm always lending out my comics and I wanted a simple way of keeping track of them.

I planned for a minimal design and implemented it with bootstrap. The basic functions are working, but I hope to get to the icebox ideas in the future.

#### Technologies Used
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails (db postgres)
- Bootstrap
- CSS, Jquery & Javascript
- HTML


#### MVP

- ~~As a user, I'd like to see a homepage that indexes all the users.~~
- ~~As a user, I'd like to be able to log-in.~~
- ~~As a user, I'd like to be able to add, edit, and remove comics.~~
- ~~As a user, I want to store my comics with multiple fields of information, including: Title, Author, Printing #, Publisher, Condition, Penciller, Inker, Colorist, Publish Date, Image URL, etc.~~
- ~~As a user, I'd like to see other users' libraries.~~
- ~~As a user, I'd like to know if someone is borrowing one of my books.~~

#### Icebox

- As a user, I'd like to add comic titles to a wish list.
- ~~As a user, I'd like to edit or remove my account.~~
- As a user, I'd like to read different user-written reviews to assess if they want the comic.
- If the person borrowing my book/s has an account, as a user, I'd like to assign their username to the borrowed book.
- As a user, I'd like to know the avg cost of a comic, the last selling price on illib, and the current selling price on Amazon.
- As a user, I'd like to put comics up on a selling block.
- As a user, I'd like to make offers to people with certain comics.
- As a user, I'd like to have a safe way to buy and sell comics.
- As a user, it'd be wonderful if an autofill function helped the adding comic process.

#### Problems

There's something strange in the check out modal.  It works if you use the enter key, but only works 50% of the time if you try to press the button. I'm not sure why this occurs.

#### Next Steps

I would like to add my icebox features. This would require extra models, controllers, and a couple APIs.

I'd like to redesign the site as well. I'd like to make more art for the site myself instead of using found clip-art.
